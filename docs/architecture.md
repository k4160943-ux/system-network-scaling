# System Network Scaling – Architecture

## Purpose
Define the high-level architecture and design principles for a scalable, secure system network.

## Design Principles
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Horizontal scalability first
- Observability by default
- Security as a baseline, not an add-on

## Core Components
- Ingress Layer
- Compute Layer
- Data Layer
- Control Plane
- Observability Stack

## Data Flow (High Level)
Describe how requests move through the system.

## Scaling Strategy
Document how the system scales under load.

## Failure Modes & Resilience
How the system degrades and recovers.

## Open Questions
Items intentionally left unresolved.
